    <h2>This Website!</h2>

        This website was originally intended to be a simple "who am I" page about myself.
        I started this project as a way to pass the time during the break I had between HSC and university.
        After taking COMP1531 in term 3 of 2026, this website has turned into a way to practically apply what I've learnt. 
        These skills include: express, git and javascript.
        There's no need for a screenshot of the website here, I guess, but here's some detail and thought about how I created this website:

    <h2>Simplex Code Editor</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/editmond/Simplex" target ="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Named Simplex, after the geometrical idea of the simplest objects in an n-th dimensional space 
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex" target ="_blank">read more</a>),
        it aims to be the starting point for all developers.
        I created this project as my major work for Software Design and Development in my final year of schooling.
        It is a lightweight code editor designed to run natively on MacOS, using Swift and SwiftUI.
        On top of providing an environment to edit code, 
            the Simplex code editor has in built file previewing and functionality for an in-app music player.
